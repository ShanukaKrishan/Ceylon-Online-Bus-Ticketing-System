## Description

"Flutter application to make transactions between the bus conductor and the passenger easier by providing a QR code. The QR code contains the passenger details along with the bus route and wheather the passenger subscribed to a montly or weekly package"



## Abstract

The Ceylon Online Bus Ticketing System is a mobile app developed with the 
ambitious motive of making public transportation more easier and hassle â€“ free for the regular passengers. The motive of the COBTS application is to replace the simple, yet tedious sequence of actions included in public transportation and make it more user friendly and easy. 
The COBTS is a simple downloadable application which allows users to create and manage a user account through which they can navigate and subscribe to one or multiple bus routes pertaining to their requirement and subscribe on a monthly basis. After the subscription, the user will receive a QR code, which will be scanned by the bus conductor upon entering the bus which will determine and warrant that the user has paid and renewed the monthly subscription or not. Additionally, the user can easily search and navigate routes according to how often they were searched for in that certain location with the help of location enabling. A timetable on the estimated arrival and departure of buses along the selected routes will also be provided for the passenger as an additional facility.
